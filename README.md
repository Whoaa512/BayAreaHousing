This is a guide on finding housing in the Bay Area. This guide is strongly, strongly, strongly aimed at those who work for technology companies or are heavily involved with techonology or 'startups'.

A Process Overview:
Here's how finding housing might look.
Where should I live? 
How much do I want to pay?
Which places are available?
How much can I really afford to pay?
How long is it going to take me to find a house?
How can I find an individual room to rent?
How can I find a couch to crash on while I find a place to live?

Unfortunately, this isn't all that far from the truth.
Finding a house in San Francisco or the South Bay is a bitch. Maybe this guide can make that 1% easier, and if it does, cool.

This guide is going to start out as more of a collection of useful and vetted resources, and as time goes on the aim is to have more and more of the information contained within the guide itself.

## Step 0: Get a sense of the big picture

The best way to do this is to read over some longer accounts of people who've reported their experiences finding housing in the Bay Area, or people who asked for help with this and received advice.

## Step 1: Where should I live?

> Do you want mellow, relaxing, spacious SF, gritty loft hipster SF, dense urban SF or suburban SF? 
*I have no friggen idea.*

To decide where you should live, examine the following factors:

 - Where will I be commuting to most often
 - Where are my friends living

Then, it's time to do some reading and come up with a shortlist.

**Notes and my thoughts**
Explore the places. Get a shortlist, and visit these places. Couchsurf there, or stay with people you know who live in these areas. Don't half ass it, either - one night in one neighborhood and one night in another isn't going to give you tons of information. 
Try and identify places where you'll be living around people you enjoy spending time with. Research has consistently shown that relationships are one of the most important factors contributing to happiness (funnily enough, having a short commute has also been shown to contribute to happiness) - so optimize for living near/with cool people, and near places you'll be traveling.


## Step 2: How can I get a place?

> Without a massive budget or perfect credit (750+), it's gonna be hard.

> I am an apartment manager of a 24 unit building in Nob Hill. First of all, pick an area that you want to live in and only look there, you will get very worn out if you trek all over the city looking at places. Each area is very unique, and will have different pluses and minuses. If you work downtown my building is a 10 minute walk to the Financial District. I am not saying this because I have any openings (which I don't), but for the way the rental market works in SF. I always post my ads on Craigslist and within a day I usually have at least 20+ responses back. I set up an open house from let's say 7 - 8:30 pm. It always pays off to be the first people there. Also, come prepared with everything (paystub, bank records, credit report...), even a check for a security deposit. If it is the middle of the month and you can't move in until the 1st of the next month, you just basically took yourself out of the pool. Also I would not recommend dealing with any big property management places. I work for a guy who privately owns 9 buildings in the city. If something goes wrong, or you have to get out of a lease, you will be screwed over. Privately owned is the way to go. My last advice would be to once you have figured out the neighborhood you like, walk every block and call the units that have the for rent sign hanging up. Most likely those are privately owned and your jumping in before others reply back to postings on line. Good Luck!

> To put some perspective - I emailed 246 postings in the past 3 weeks, went to dozens of apartment showings and open houses. I just got approved and selected for a place today, with 8 days until my deadline. It gets insanely stressful. 

> Have a copy of your credit report in hand and be ready to write a deposit check on the spot. My experience has been the best SF apartments go fast and to those that are prepared. Also, if the circumstance is sketchy or too good to be true, it probably is ---- there have been a couple of cases in recent years where people were scammed out of deposits, end up without an apartment.

**Avoid Housing Scams**

> I'm just starting my search as well, and it's definitely a struggle - most of the people I've emailed so far have pretty clearly been scammers who refuse to show the location, want a deposit asap, and when I call the actual location, the real owners have never heard of.

> Do Not Use Citiapartments / Syline Reality / First Apartments. They are well known for being massive shits and enemies of SF renters. They also own a lot of property here. [Source: Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/fjbpb/anyone_know_a_place_i_can_find_an_apartment_in/c1gdkhp)

> I'd advise filling out a generic application and pulling your credit on your own to take with you to viewings. Also, plan on a good chunk of emails coming back with scammers or spam. Don't fill out any application stuff online until you see the apartment inside with your own eyes. 

**Don't Give Up Hope**
> It can happen. My boyfriend and I found a place in 4 days by constantly refreshing craigslist and politely stalking landlords. Have your credit check, proof of employment and some stock applications in hand when you go there. We signed our lease at the showing.
